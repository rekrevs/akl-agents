## Philosophy

Each attempt is an experiment. We expect early attempts to fail - that's OK. The goal is to learn systematically and improve our approach with each iteration.

See **docs/porting/13-ITERATIVE-STRATEGY.md** for details on our learning process.

## Attempt Status

| Attempt | Branch | Status | Outcome | Key Learning |
