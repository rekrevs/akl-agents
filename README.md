# AGENTS (version 0.9)

## 1 INTRODUCTION

The **Agents Kernel Language (AKL)** is a concurrent constraint programming language developed at the Swedish Institute of Computer Science (SICS). In AKL, computation is performed by agents interacting through stores of constraints. This notion accommodates multiple programming paradigms; in appropriate contexts, AKL agents may be thought of as processes, objects, functions, relations, or constraints.

**AGENTS** is a system for programming in AKL. It provides:
- A complete implementation of AKL with equality constraints over rational trees.
- Various "finite domain" constraints over integers.
- Ports (a novelty of AKL).
- Assorted built-in agents and other support.

## 3 INSTALLATION

### Condensed Version
```bash
./configure
make
```

To build documentation:
```bash
make dvi    # Generates .dvi files in ./doc/
make ps     # Generates .ps files in ./doc/
```

Ensure at least **8 MB of disk space** for building.

### Full Installation Guide

1. **Configure**  
   `./configure` generates `Makefile` based on your system. Supported arguments:
   - `--host=HOST`: Build for host type (e.g., `rs6000-ibm-aix3.2`).
   - `--prefix=DIR`: Install AGENTS in `DIR` (default: `/usr/local`).
   - `--srcdir=DIR`: Source directory (default: current directory).
   - `--without-gmp`: Disable bignum support (not recommended).

   Example:
   ```bash
   ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
   ```

2. **Build**  
   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. **Install**  
   ```bash
   make install
   ```
   Requires ~6 MB disk space. Installed versions are standalone.

4. **Shadow Builds**  
   Use `mkbuilddirs` for out-of-tree builds:
   ```bash
   ./mkbuilddirs $(pwd) ../rs6000
   cd ../rs6000
   ./configure
   make
   ```

## 4 USING AGENTS

### Basic Commands
- Start the AGENTS top level:
  ```bash
  agents
  ```
- Compile a program (`program.akl` â†’ `program.pam`):
  ```prolog
  ?- compilef(program).
  ```
- Load a compiled program:
  ```prolog
  ?- load(program).
  ```
- Compile and load in one step:
  ```prolog
  ?- compile(program).
  ```

### Debugger
- Start/stop the debugger:
  ```prolog
  ?- trace.     # Start
  ?- notrace.   # Stop
  ```
- Set spy points for debugging.
