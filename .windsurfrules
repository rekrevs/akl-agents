Never edit Makefile and other files that are generated by the build system.
e.g. parser.y is generated from parser.y.m4
When there is a .in file, edit that instead of the generated file.

When a problem occurs, our first priority is to identify its root cause.
We will not jump to conclusions.
We do not look for ways to circumvent a problem.

When problem solving, always present findings and analysis first.
Discuss potential solutions with user.
Get your explicit approval before starting to implement any specific solution.
Never create new files or make significant changes without user's consent.

We are always looking for clean, simple, and maintainable solutions.
We do not make kludges just to get things working.

Never edit .windsurfrules
