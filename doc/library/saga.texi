This is the run time library that is used with the programs generated by
SAGA (Syntax Analyzer Generator in AKL).  There is a manual page "saga"
which shows how to invoke "saga" on a "saga" file
which contains a description based on regular expressions and
LALR(1) context free grammars, similar to that of lex and yacc.
The format of the saga file is described in the SAGA Report available in
the documentation area in the Agents source file area.
The "saga" command will the generate an Agents program that needs the
saga run time library.

To load the saga run time, enter the query

@example
| ?- load(library(sagaruntime)).
@end example
