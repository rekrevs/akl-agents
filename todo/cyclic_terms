Unify should be modified (a'la SICStus) to deal
correctly with cyclic data-structures. The solution
should also encompass generic objects.

The machinery is now in place. There is a special callback protocol for
generic objects that need to detect cycles, see comments in unify.c.

Printing of cyclic structures is implemented by registering visited
pointers in a hash table associated with the stream. This is a temporary
solution: ideally, cycle detection should be done by an object-to-meta
translator, and writing agents should work with the meta-level representation.
