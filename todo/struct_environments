The presence or absence of environment fields in structures
should be selectable at runtime (or at least boot-time).

Possible scenarios:

	Certain functors always have them, others don't.

	A command-line option turns them on for everything (except lists?)

	Some obscure technique with hidden flag bits (or something)
	that enables the feature to be turned on per individual struct.

	Leave them on at all times, and live with the extra speed and
	storage overhead.
