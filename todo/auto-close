Port-like objects should place a constraint in their environment andbox.
This constraint points out structures that need to be copied by GC when
the object is auto-closed.

Ordinary ports should be specially treated in gc_close(), so that streams
that are instantiated to structures need not be copied. Instead, a special
recall entry is made that causes the port's andbox to fail.

An object that wants to be closed in the wrong branch is simply copied,
and a special magic constraint is placed in the toplevel andbox of that
branch, that causes the object to be closed when installing the andbox.
