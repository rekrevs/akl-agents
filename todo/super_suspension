When an engine comes across a variable which is
external to the current reflection (a meta-variable),
the whole reflection should suspend.  It may not make
any assumptions on the value of a meta-variable.

there are complications:

In a parallel implementation, what should be done
with other workers?

Shouldn't really everything be done that could be
done on the current configuration?  If the goal
following this one would fail (without touching
meta-variables), shouldn't it be allowed to?
