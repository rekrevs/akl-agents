%  Purpose: Database handler using ports
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%  This is a database handler that will let you insert and look up
%%%%  data based on a ground key. The data also has to be ground.
%%%%  
%%%%  A lookup will suspend until there is somthing to read based on that
%%%%  key. This will allow syncronisation but be carefull not to close
%%%%  before you are done with the database.
%%%%
%%%%  db_open(-Port)			Create database port
%%%%
%%%%  clean				Remove all data
%%%%  kill				Close the port
%%%%  insert(+Key, +Val)		Insert data
%%%%  lookup(+Key, -Val, -Status)	Lookup data, Status = yes or no
%%%%  sync(-Flag)			Something to wait for even if no
%%%%					real need of data.
