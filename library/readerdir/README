 routines for reading and writing AKL programs 
  forming library(reader)

utilities.akl
	various definitions of general use in AKL programs.
	(moved to main library directory, no longer part of library(reader)).

map.akl
	definitions for applying definitions to each element
	in a list
	(moved to main library directory, no longer part of library(reader)).

syntax.akl
	definitions for the syntactic components of AKL programs.

rwrDTERM0.akl
	definitions for reading and writing terms of the
	form DTERM0.

convDTERM0toDTERM1.akl
	definitions for converting terms between
	the form DTERM0 and the form DTERM1.	
 	
rwrDTERM1.akl
	definitions for reading and writing terms of the
	form DTERM1.

convDTERM1toDPROGRAM.akl
	definitions for converting terms between
	the form DTERM1 and the form DPROGRAM.

convDPROGRAMtoDPROGRAM.akl
	definitions for conversion and information extraction
	in elements of the type DPROGRAM.

annotDPROGRAM.akl
	definitions for handling annotations 
 	in elements of the type DPROGRAM.

Makefile
	contains productions for compiling .pam-files from .akl-files,
	and the running of a test-example after first loading the
	appropriate files. 
  	'make' constructs reader.pam on the directory ..
	'make test' performs the query in the makefile variable $AKLCOMMAND
		e.g. 'normalize_program(test)'. or 'xref(test).'
	'make clean' removes pam-files
	'make debug' constructs 'query.akl' used for debugging

README
	this file

toplevel.akl
	test-queries

test?
	files used as input to the tested definitions, 
 	e.g. normalize_program/2 constructs a file "N.norm" from the input 
	file N.
