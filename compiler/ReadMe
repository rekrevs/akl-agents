This compiler is upon request made available for group members to peruse. The compiler is still
under development and will not reach the prototype stage for some time.

Don't expect the compiler to do anything useful other than with the examples in the examples
subdirectory. 

Don't report bugs at this time (I have more than enough as is).


To compile the file FileName.akl  the query is q(FileName)? with the compiled code output to
	FileName.bam
